# Gitular

A cross-platform desktop Git client for Linux, Windows and Mac.

Initially built to offer a great user experience that is largely not available to those using Linux (as an alternative to the 1 other option with a good UI available).

## Running

Long term this will be suitably packaged for each platform, for now it can be run using npm (node package manager).

```bash
npm run build:run
```

Currently uses the `git` command line binary, so you will need it installed and available on your platform.

## Tech Stack

Built using the best open source technologies - Git + Electron + TypeScript + Angular + Bootstrap + Font Awesome
